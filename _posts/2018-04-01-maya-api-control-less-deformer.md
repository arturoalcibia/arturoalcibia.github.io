# Control-less rig deformer like PixarÂ´s Presto

---
Below you can see the deformer in action with multiple controls plugged to the rig.

## Functionality

This deformer allows you to have rig controls directly on the mesh itself.

The setup is fairly easy once automated. Selecting the faces that
you want the control to be and the solution should automate the duplication of
geometry and plugging it into the deformer.

This had to be ported to C++ since the performance in python wouldn't be able to get to real time
performance once multiple controls had been created.

## Future plans:

- [ ] Using the GPU should improve performance and looks interesting to dive into.
